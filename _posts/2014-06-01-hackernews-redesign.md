I love challenges, aspecially in design. When i think its obvious and it is only a matter of color / font / pattern and my project is done, I come to realize that my canvas is blank and nothing is working. 

When we talk about flat design the rules are quite clear, so how come the challenge is to keep it simple? 
When I first saw Hacker News site my first impression was that the design is static and havn't renovate for years. 

my need (as many other designers) for re designing the platform (that obviously working) comes from the challenge with in. the challenge of dealing with few colors and clear design guide lines dictated by the Y Combinator. 



## Introducing the Y-Meter

<br/>

* Using visual insted of textual for ranking.
* Defining a numrtic system for ranking points - composed of 6 levels.
* keeping the Y-Combinator insignia.

## Visually

People are bussy. During the day we work and dont have alot of time to get update on the things we like and find important (outside of work). That's why I feel that when a person see a element that he is familiar with he immediately finds his way through the infomation as quickly as possible.


## Numrtic System

Human beings have limits on the capacity for processing information, as George A. Miller wrote In an article that was published in 1956 by the cognitive psychologist. My Y-Meter system presents 6 extents for ranking (0-20, 21-50, 51-100, 101-200, 201-400, 400+) so the reader will find fast what he's looking for.
## Insignia
The colors I used are origin from the "Y-Combinator" logo. I used the scale from #FFFDFC to #FF6602.

## Original vs New Design
information hierarchy


![before_after.png](/media/before_after.png)


Original

* Position in list (numerical)
* Title
* Domain
* Points
* Author
* Published date
* Comments (engagement)

New Design

* Points (the Y-Meter)
* Title.
* Comments (engagement)
* Author
* Domain
* Publish date

The information hierarchy in the new design is diffrent. The new organization allows the reader to find his way around more quickly by horizontal scan of the title, from what i belive is more important. 


The Y-Meter which represents the points, is at the begining of the line. Follow by the title is self. The title in the new design is bigger and more readable. The font (Helvetica Nueue) is for a modern, cleaner look.


After comes the Comments. Unlike the origin version, I belive that the comments should come right after the title becouse they indicates on how intersting the article is and how much buzz it have.  After that comes the Author - Information that is less relevante for the bussy reader. The same is for the Domain section. 


Finally the publication Date. The date it self is less relevant doe to the fact that the articles that stacking upward are the most recent ones. 

## Readability

All of the information orginize in one line which gives a better separation of information. The background color is 3% of the base color #FF6602  - it's lighter then the origin one and provide higher contrast. 

Using the visual aspect in my opinion, ease on the eye that moves in a single motion per item when scanning the line. 

## My Guide Line

* Minimal design
* Re inventing the HN concept
* Expose new alternatives for the rating system (introducing the Y-meter)
* New way of showing information (hierarchy)
* Fonts significance
* Color utilization
